# Project Title: Simple Games
### made using Python.

This repository contains some classic games that I developed on my own as solutions to questions on coding platforms - <a href = "https://skillsforall.com/course/python-essentials-1?courseLang=en-US&instance_id=da0847b7-e6fc-4597-bc31-38ddd6b07a2e">"Cisco Networking Academy - PCAP Python Essentials"</a> and <a href = "https://www.codechef.com/learn/course/projects-python">"Codechef - Python Projects"</a>.
<br><br>
You can find the following games here:
- Tic Tac Toe
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Guess The Number
- Hangman<br>

Check out each folder's Readme to learn more about each game.
<br><br>
I encourage you to simply clone this repository and play these games, right from your CLI!<br>Perfect for those times when you're just bored or tired of work - use these games as a quick way to take a break :))
