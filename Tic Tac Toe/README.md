# pathak's "pyTicTacToe"
## For when you're bored and craving a game of good old Tic Tac Toe in your Terminal

Recall how, in our childhood, we played <i>Zero Kaata</i> on the last pages of our notebooks in school.
I created this project out of a desire to revise and work on my Python skills with an amateur yet fun idea. <b>And for the nostalgia</b>.

This was also my submission for what is known as one of the most challenging tasks in Cisco Networking Academy's "PCAP-Programming Essentials in Python" course.
The layout of the 'board' was inspired by their prompt for "Project: Tic Tac Toe".

## Background Info.
Instructions given by the course for this game that I implemented by myself are as follows: 
### Scenario:
Your task is to write a simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user. We've decided to simplify the game. Here are our assumptions:

1. The computer (i.e., your program) should play the game using 'X's;
2. The user (e.g., you) should play the game using 'O's;
3. The first move belongs to the computer − it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board;
4. All the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1 (see the example session below for reference)
5. The user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose − the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;
6. The program checks if the game is over − there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins;
7. The computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
8. Don't implement any form of artificial intelligence − a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.

## Notes
Yes, there's a little bit of a <i>Command Line Interface</i> aesthetic to it, so you can call it basic ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I may add some more functionality (or who knows, more games!?) to this repo later on.
1. Would really like to play with the art of waiting and make the game play out more dramatically, instead of it delivering results as soon as you press Enter.
2. Imagine I revamp this using Tkinter and make a full-fledged GUI for this (<b>HAHA THAT'D BE SICK</b>).
